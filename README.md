# Lobot Description (HIGHLY DYSFUNCTIONAL)

This repo supposedly contains all the urdf and potentially mesh files for the lobot

However, as of right now because Xacro cannot be ran on ROS2 the urdf files are currently under a ROS1 repo.
The only thing useful from this repo is the robots/biped.urdf, which is generated using ROS1 xacro.
